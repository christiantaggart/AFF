Follow [this tutorial](https://github.com/haydenjameslee/networked-aframe/blob/master/docs/getting-started-local.md) to build your own example.

Edit online example with [glitch.com/~networked-aframe/](https://glitch.com/~networked-aframe/)

To run the examples on your own PC:

 ```sh
git clone https://github.com/haydenjameslee/networked-aframe.git  # Clone the repository.
cd networked-aframe
npm install && npm run easyrtc-install  # Install dependencies.
npm run dev  # Start the local development server.
